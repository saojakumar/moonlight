       <p>Facts About The Moon The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite and the fifth largest moon in the solar system. 
        The Moon’s presence helps stabilize our planet’s wobble and moderate our climate.
         The Moon’s distance from Earth is about 240,000 miles (385,000km). The Moon has a very thin atmosphere called an exosphere.
         The Moon is Earth's only proper natural satellite. At one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia), 
         it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet,
          and the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall (larger than any dwarf planet).

        Our lunar neighbor has inspired stories since the first humans looked up at the sky and saw its gray, cratered surface. 
        Some observers saw among the craters the shape of a person's face, so stories refer to a mysterious "man in the Moon."
         Hungrier observers compared the craters to cheese and dreamed of an entire sphere made of delicious dairy products.

        The Moon made its film debut in a 1902 black and white silent French film called "Le Voyage Dans la Lune" ("A Trip to the Moon").
         And a year before astronauts walked on the Moon, "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968) told the story of astronauts on an outpost on the Moon. Decades later,
         it is still widely regarded as one of the best science fiction movies ever made.

        American astronauts have planted six American flags on the Moon. But that doesn't mean the United States has claimed it; in fact, 
        an international law written in 1967 prevents any single nation from owning planets,
         stars, or any other natural objects in space.

        Most of the planets in our solar system – and some asteroids – have moons. Earth has one moon.
         We call it "the Moon" because for a long time it was the only one we knew about.
         Many languages have beautiful names for our Moon. It is "Luna" in Italian, 
        Latin, and Spanish, "Lune" in French, "Mond" in German, and "Selene" in Greek.

        Chances are that when you imagine the night sky, one of the first things that comes to mind is the Moon “glowing” in the darkness.
         The Moon has always held a special place in our imaginations and in daily life.

         From Earth, it might look like the Moon is changing shape each night – from a tiny sliver to a half moon to a full moon and back again. 
         What’s actually happening is that from our spot on Earth,
          we see different parts of the Moon lit up by the Sun as the Moon travels in its orbit.
